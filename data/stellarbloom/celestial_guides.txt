Each cadet is paired with a Celestialâ€”a seasoned Corps member who serves not just as a mentor, but as a spiritual guide.

Celestials are attuned to the emotional frequencies of their cadets. They see the strength hidden beneath the pain, the light behind the shadow.
Their role is to challenge, support, and guide cadets through their Bloom, helping them awaken the star within.
