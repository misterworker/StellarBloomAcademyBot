Joining the Astral Corps is not a simple enlistment—it requires initiation through The Bloom.
This rite isn’t about combat or physical excellence. It’s an inward journey—a sacred unfolding of the self.

Cadets must confront their buried truths, heal emotional wounds, and nourish their inner world to unlock their full soul-potential.
